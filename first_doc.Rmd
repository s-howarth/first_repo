## R Markdown

This report documents my first attempt at using GitHub and Git for version control! So Now I'm just changing the report so that I can stage and commmit the changes.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
